Wonder Wall

Wonder Wall is an interactive 3D video game that combines learning and fun by controlling characters through head movement. It features two modes: Learning Mode, where you test your knowledge by selecting correct answers to gain points, and Fun Mode, where you dodge obstacles, collect coins, and reach the goal through challenging scenarios.

The game was developed using the iPlus methodology and the Simple Interaction Life Cycle Model, allowing for continuous improvements. It integrates gamification elements to boost motivation and applies Nielsen heuristics for an accessible user experience.

Built with Unity and programmed in C#, Wonder Wall includes 3D models and animations for enhanced gameplay. The project structure includes:

/Assets/ for models, scripts, animations, and settings

/Scripts/ with C# source code

/Scenes/ for preconfigured game levels

/Documentation/ with manuals and guides

/Audio/ for sound and music

To play, ensure a safe space free of obstacles, preferably sitting. Put on your VR headset, start the game, and create a session. Complete the tutorial to learn controls, then enjoy either mode: answer correctly in Learning Mode to score points or navigate obstacles in Fun Mode.

To install, clone the repository with:

git clone https://github.com/Ricker2020/WonderWall.git

Open the project in Unity and replace the Assets folder with the downloaded code.
